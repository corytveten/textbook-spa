Textbook Database

I created a textbook database app. In my current position, I research course materials for schools across the country for articulation agreements and transfer credit. Databases of school catalogs are available online, but it is difficult to get specific information about courses beyond the course description. The title alone of a textbook can provide useful evidence of the level and content of a course, and having quick access to this information would be valuable to people working in my field. I imagine the user of this app to be an academic administrator or counselor who would like to keep track of information they have accrued in past research (e.g., textbooks). This app could be expanded to keep records like transferability of courses between two different schools.

The app is structured around three Ruby classes: School, Course, and Textbook. A user can add a new instance of any of these three classes, but only a school can be introduced completely new, without a foreign key. Courses must be attached to a school and textbooks must be attached to a course.
